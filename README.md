# ToolHub Frontend
> A frontend infrastructure for ToolHub. You can search for tools that can be edited and used by the community,
> see some metrics on overall tools and also check leaderboard on the top editors in the last 30 days.

## Thoughts process behind the design
The design is based on the [ToolHub](https://toolhub.wikimedia.org/) and [Citation Hunt](https://citationhunt.toolforge.org/en?id=c82245e2) project. 
The home or index page is the search page where you can search for tools. The search page is also the default page when you visit the site. I have some
tools that have missing field displaying on the home page. I then thought adding dynamic links to all the cards on the home page would be a good idea, so 
if you click on the card, it will take you to the tool page. The tool page is where you can see the details of the tool and also edit the tool (but the edit is not implemented yet).
